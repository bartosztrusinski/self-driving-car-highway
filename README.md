# Car driving simulation

Drive the car on the highway and try to avoid traffic or just watch the artificial intelligence learn to navigate without damaging the car

## Controls

Use "WASD" or arrow keys to drive the car. Be careful not to hit any traffic car or road border as it will damage your car.

## AI

The AI uses forward-facing sensors as input. In order for the AI to learn how to drive, click the "save" button to save the farthest car at the moment. After refreshing the page, all parallelized AI cars will be a slight mutation of the currently saved car. If you see a better version, save again and repeat until the AI learns to drive. You can use the "cancel" button to reset the configuration and start over.
